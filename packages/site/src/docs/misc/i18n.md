## Update translated strings

When changes have been made to spreadsheeet and you want to publish them:

- Go to `./packages/scripts` and run `pnpm updateLocales`
- Note the JSON files are generated in the `site/packages/src/lib/i18n/locales` folder (and now a few other places)
- check each file via PR review as the Google Sheet sometimes has bugs on strings still being machine translated

## Deploy new language

- Add bcp code and vernacular name to appropriate array in `./packages/site/src/lib/i18n/locales.ts`
- Go to `./packages/scripts` and run `pnpm updateLocales`

## Adding new string

- Add new string to translation spreadsheet
  - Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SqtfUvYYAEQSFTaTPoAJq6k-wlbuAgWCkswE_kiUhLs/edit#gid=0 if it is a new string (i18n Ally will help you see if it's new - also search for similar strings and make sure we're not duplicating).
  - Add the string at the bottom of the 1st column, then choose a component name that's already in use or use 'misc' if it's sitewide and doesn't belong in one particular component
  - Add an item id in the item column that exactly matches the string but with underscore casing unless it's a longer string then choose a descriptive string
  - wait for Google translate to do the magic on the other languages then update the translated strings in the app as described above in **Update Translated Strings**
  - let Anna know so she can let the translators know to improve the Google translate piece when it seems a good time to her

### Use in Svelte files

- Read the [docs](https://poly-i18n.vercel.app/kitbook/docs/3-use-with-sveltekit#use-from-page-data-store)

```svelte
<script>
  import { page } from '$app/stores'
</script>

{$page.data.t('hello.world')}
```

### Use in TS files

```ts
import { get } from 'svelte/store'
import { page } from '$app/stores'

export function sayHi() {
  const { data: { t } } = get(page)
  alert(t('hello.world'))
}
```

## TODO

- Subdivide messages files based on part of site to avoid needing to load in all translations for the app at once. See example in https://github.com/kaisermann/sapper-template-i18n/blob/master/src/routes/about/index.svelte
