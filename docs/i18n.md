## Update translated strings

When changes have been made to spreadsheeet and you want to publish them:

- Go to `./packages/scripts` and run `pnpm updateLocales`
- Note the JSON files are generated in the `src/locales` folder (and now a few other places)
- check each file as the Google Sheet sometimes had bugs

## Deploy new language

- Add bcp code and vernacular name to appropriate array in packages\types\languages.interface.ts
- Go to `./packages/scripts` and run `pnpm updateLocales`

## Usage when developing

- Add new string to component using `$_('entry.sr')` from `import { _ } from 'svelte-i18n';` as seen in docs at: https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-i18n/blob/main/docs/Getting%20Started.md
- Add new string to translation spreadsheet
  - Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SqtfUvYYAEQSFTaTPoAJq6k-wlbuAgWCkswE_kiUhLs/edit#gid=0 if it is a new string (i18n Ally will help you see if it's new - also search for similar strings and make sure we're not duplicating).
  - Add the string at the bottom of the 1st column, then choose a component name that's already in use or use 'misc' if it's sitewide and doesn't belong in one particular component
  - Add an item id in the item column that exactly matches the string but with underscore casing unless it's a longer string then choose a descriptive string
  - wait for Google translate to do the magic on the other languages then update the translated strings in the app as described above in **Update Translated Strings**
  - let Anna know so she can let the translators know to improve the Google translate piece when it seems a good time to her

### Using Translations in .js/.ts files

```
import { _ } from 'svelte-i18n';

export function shout() {
    _.subscribe(_ => {
        alert(_('nav.home')); // will not be found by svelte-i18n extract CLI option
    })(); // the final function call is to immediately unsubscribe
}
```

or

```
import { \_ } from 'svelte-i18n';
import { get } from 'svelte/store';

export function shout() {
    const $_ = get(_);
        alert($\_('nav.home')); // will not be found by svelte-i18n extract CLI option
    }
}
```

## TODO

- Subdivide messages files based on part of site to avoid needing to load in all translations for the app at once. See example in https://github.com/kaisermann/sapper-template-i18n/blob/master/src/routes/about/index.svelte
